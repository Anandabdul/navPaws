  <h1 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Welcome to NavPaws Animal Rescue!</h1>

  <p class="fs-4">At NavPaws Animal Rescue, our mission is to give every animal a second chance at a happy, healthy life. We are a dedicated team of animal lovers and professionals who work tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals in need.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Our Story</h3>

  <p class="fs-4">NavPaws was founded in 2015 by a group of passionate volunteers who saw a critical need for more comprehensive animal rescue services in our community. What started as a small operation has grown into a vibrant network of volunteers, foster homes, and supporters, all united by a common goal: to save lives and create a world where every animal is valued and cared for.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">What We Do</h3>
  
  <h4 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Rescue</h4>
  
  <p class="fs-4">We rescue animals from a variety of situations, including those abandoned, abused, or surrendered by their owners. Our rescue efforts are not limited to cats and dogs; we extend our services to all types of animals in need.</p>
  
  <h4 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Rehabilitation</h4>
  
  <p class="fs-4">Once an animal is in our care, we provide necessary medical treatment, behavioral training, and plenty of love and attention to help them recover and thrive. Our team works closely with veterinarians and animal behaviorists to ensure each animal gets the best possible care.</p>
  
  <h4 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Rehoming</h4>
  
  <p class="fs-4">Our ultimate goal is to find permanent, loving homes for the animals in our care. We carefully screen potential adopters and match them with animals that fit their lifestyle and environment. We also provide ongoing support to ensure successful, long-term adoptions.</p>
  
  <h3 class="fw-bold text-warning text-center">Our Team</h3>
  
  <p class="fs-4">Our team is made up of dedicated volunteers, foster families, and animal care professionals. Each member brings their unique skills and unwavering compassion to our organization, making it possible to provide exceptional care and support to every animal we rescue.</p>
